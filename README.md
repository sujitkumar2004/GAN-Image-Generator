# GAN Image Generator

A hands-on project implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using **PYTHON**, **TENSORFLOW**, and **KERAS** to generate synthetic images from random noise. This project is based on the tutorial by [Nick Renotte](https://youtu.be/AALBGpLbj6Q?si=lDs2Gw9Q9AEvwWH9) and serves as a foundational exercise in deep learning and adversarial training.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores the architecture and training process of a GAN, including:
- A **Generator** that learns to create realistic images from random input.
- A **Discriminator** that learns to distinguish between real and fake images.
- **Adversarial training**, where both models improve in tandem.
- Visualization of generated outputs over training epochs.
